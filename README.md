# Welcome
Welcome to the CloudBees examples repository. This repository is a place for storing tutorials, examples, and other learning materials to complement mentions in product documentation.
Of note:

* It is owned and managed by the docs team.
* This repo contains assets that complement mentions in product documentation.  As such, it is not standalone.
* It is pre-populated with top-level product folders. Organize content in sub-folders appropriate to your files or projects.

## Managing asset links
* When providing a link in product documentation to a repo asset, consider using the raw link where appropriate. This gives the reader a cut/paste-ready version of the asset.
* Choose prudent filenames to minimize future renames. Simply moving a file to a new name breaks exiting links out in the wild. It is recommended to leverage symbolic links to effect "redirects". The following shows how to rename `origfile.yaml` and then create a hard link to this original name. As a result, links to the old name will automatically "redirect" to the new name.

  ```shell
  // move old file to new name
  git mv origfile.yaml newfile.yaml
  git commit -m "commit message"
  git push

  // create link to old file
  ln  newfile.yaml origfile.yaml

  // add, commit, and push the symlink
  git add origfile.yaml
  git commit -m "created symlink to the original file"
  git push
  ```
